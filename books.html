                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        <p>If we treat Revelation as a novel, its storyline is the archaeological discoveries and ancient records. Yet countless details remain obscured by the mists of time, gaps that only imagination can fill. It is in those blank spaces, those uncharted corridors of history, where the mind roams free.</p>

                                        <p>First, we must speak of the Xia Dynasty. Some say it was not truly a "dynasty." Its domain seemed small, confined to the Luoyang Basin. It had no writing system of its own. But within the Erlitou culture—attributed to the Xia—bronze artifacts were found, along with evidence of dragon worship. From this tradition, we call ourselves "descendants of the dragon." It may sound poetic, yet there is some historical truth behind it. That said, we do not know what creature the "dragon" truly was. The climate then was subtropical; water buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephants roamed the land. I wonder if the dragon might have been some sort of crocodile, lurking in the warm wetlands, mistaken for a mythical beast.</p>

                                        <p>As for Yu the Great controlling floods—our writer here believes he was less a master of floodwaters and more an innovator of wetlands. He replaced millet fields with rice paddies and thus boosted productivity. The Xia practiced human sacrifice, but not as extensively as other ancient tribes. They had a colony near Lake Chao in Anhui, too. All these details blend into a picture of a small realm, rough around the edges, yet already forging the beginnings of a legacy.</p>

                                        <p>In later times, records of the Zhou Dynasty were pieced together by Confucius into the Shangshu ("Book of Documents"), specifically the portion called the "Zhou Book." There was also another set of writings that Confucius set aside, known as the Yizhoushu ("Lost Book of Zhou"), which modern scholars still regard as significant. It states that the Xia resided in the Luoyang region—a claim scarcely mentioned elsewhere, yet borne out by archaeological evidence from Erlitou. So, the Yizhoushu may hold more truth than people once suspected.</p>

                                        <p>When we turn to the Shang Dynasty, the human sacrifices are more frequent and more brutal. Instead of dying down over time, these dark rites grew fiercer as the Shang weakened. Early Shang cities like Yanshi and Zhengzhou showed signs of this grim practice. Later, when the capital moved to Anyang, human sacrifice increased instead of waning. Today, Yanshi and Anyang are sprawling cities, and beneath their foundations lie countless tragic remains. I have lived in these places for years, never suspecting the horrors beneath my feet.</p>

                                        <p>The book also speaks of the Taixi site near Shijiazhuang, describing the Shang people as "bronze warriors," reminiscent of seasoned soldiers forging a life of battle rather than farming. The most harrowing detail is the discovery of scattered human skulls around the eaves of their homes. One imagines these heads once dangled for all to see—a sight straight from the darkest corner of a horror story.</p>

                                        <p>The Shang royal family carried the surname "Zi," while the Zhou family's name was "Ji." Even Confucius bore the surname "Zi," with "Kong" as his clan name. In those ancient days, the surname bound an entire bloodline; the clan name was a narrower branch within that lineage. So, even if everyone shared "Zi," they could be split into different clans—like the "Kong clan" for Confucius.</p>

                                        <p>The Shang often named children by the day's celestial stem. Hence the names Xin, Yi, Bing, and Ding. The Shang realm itself was vast, stretching across the rare earth deposits of the region all the way to the outskirts of Xi'an, and extending southward to areas near present-day Wuhan and eastward to Tengzhou. Of the many kings who ruled Shang, one of the most famous was Wu Ding, alongside his wife, Fu Hao—frequent figures in the oracle bone inscriptions. There, one finds many references to violence. Even the character for "teach" features a hand gripping a stick, over divination lines and the character for "child," giving "teaching" a harsh dimension.</p>

                                        <p>The Shang also learned to use chariots from the Middle East, though their numbers were small. In contrast, great kingdoms like Egypt and the Hittites once clashed in battles of a thousand chariots. The Shang never approached that scale.</p>

                                        <p>Closer to the dawn of the Zhou, archaeologists uncovered King Wen's estate at the foot of Qishan, in a place called Fengchu Village. The layout of the house recalls today's siheyuan courtyard, except it contained a vast cellar. Inside were troves of oracle bones, their inscriptions tiny as if King Wen was secretly engraving his own private diary—scribbles on divination and the seeds of what became the I Ching.</p>

                                        <p>King Wen had several sons. The eldest, Bo Yikao (once called Zhou Yi, with "Bo" denoting the firstborn), was killed by the last Shang ruler. The second son became King Wu of Zhou. And a younger son was the Duke of Zhou, known as Zhou Gong Dan, or Ji Dan. This Duke of Zhou abolished human sacrifice and led the people toward virtue rather than fear of spirits. According to Li Shuo, the establishment of the Zhou Dynasty signaled humanity's climb from a savage age of blood and bone into a more orderly and enlightened society.</p>

                                        <p>And so we stand upon these ancient footprints, half-buried in legend, half-revealed by the spade. In those dark spaces between facts, imagination flickers and brings the past alive with all its wonders—and horrors.</p>

                                        <p>I never cared for modern art. I don't see why folks must flock to New York just to make it. You don't see mathematicians huddling together in one city to figure out their numbers. Besides, modern art baffles me.</p>

                                        <p>This book, too, has its faults. When it describes some patch of New York, it rattles off a string of names as if reading a menu. Makes me think that before you can make art, you have to join the right circle. And once you're in, you'd better know everyone in it by heart.</p>

                                        <p>Still, the book moves you. Or at least, it stays your hand from giving it a poor review. Because at its core, it tells the story of two people who knew how to love, and how they came to love each other.</p>

                                        <p>Loving another soul is never easy. Selfishness, fear, and petty pride all get in the way. Yet Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe loved so purely that words like "love" or "friendship" can't hold the weight of what they shared. I would call it art. A kind of art I can understand.</p>

                                        <p>It reminds me of the last memoir I read that was finer than the writer's other works—Li Ao's. He, too, lived his life as if it were art. In that sense, both he and these two lovers turned their days into something worth remembering.</p>

                                        <p>I started reading, and halfway through I thought: if the lord this butler served truly did great things for our civilization, then this must be the strangest and most ambiguous story I've ever come across. All the values, all the facts—blurred together into a fog. Yet as the plot pushed forward, the clouds lifted. We learned the lord had served as a Nazi accomplice, and his disgrace brought a kind of grim clarity. That discovery made the reading easier, though it left a bitter taste.</p>

                                        <p>On the matter of dignity, I share the view of those English country folk in the story: a slave cannot speak of dignity. We each hold a place in society, even if that place seems fixed. But we are not the property of anyone above us, nor are we fuel for an empire. We find dignity by standing firm on the side of our own humanity and saying "no" to demands that defy reason. That refusal, that act of drawing a line, is where true dignity lies.</p>

                                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-3 text-muted">November 2024</h6>
                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        <p>Reading this book, I was struck by the author's approach: a litany of war examples assembled to unearth patterns and distill overarching insights. It's a fundamental cognitive method—seeking understanding through the aggregation of cases. Yet, I can't shake the feeling that humans aren't particularly adept at this kind of data-driven discovery; it's a realm where AI truly excels. Consequently, the narrative feels, perhaps unfairly, somewhat superficial.</p>

                                        <p>What genuinely captivates me isn't the aftermath of war, but its genesis—a theme the author delves into in the second chapter. The argument is that wars aren't accidental eruptions; they require extensive psychological groundwork. This includes greed—a covetous eye on what others possess; fear that the enemy might strike first; worries that prolonged peace has softened the resolve and spirit of one's own people; dehumanizing the enemy as heretical or subhuman; and increasingly emotive appeals to honor or the erasure of past humiliations.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>But here's where my thoughts diverge. We've basked in an era of relative peace—will it endure? Have we, as a species, evolved beyond violence as a means of resolving our conflicts? On this front, the author truly shines, especially in the first chapter, which stands out as the most compelling part of the book. From an evolutionary perspective, we're reminded that our closest primate relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, exhibit starkly different behaviors—one aggressive, the other peaceable. This biological diversity suggests there's no predetermined destiny compelling humanity toward perpetual war.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>From a sociological standpoint, the emergence of complex societies has indeed heightened human cooperation, rendering us more peaceful in certain respects. Yet paradoxically, when wars do occur, their scale and intensity are magnified exponentially. This duality underscores the intricate tapestry of human social evolution.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In grappling with these issues, I find that starting from first principles—leveraging insights from evolution and sociology—and engaging in rigorous logical reasoning yields more profound and enlightening perspectives than merely cataloging historical patterns.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Furthermore, the author's exploration of the role of women in war opened new avenues of reflection for me. When we conjure images of the Nazis, it's predominantly men who occupy our imagination. But what of the German women of that era? The author recounts the story of a Nazi officer's wife, whose profound sense of disillusionment following the regime's collapse highlighted how the Nazi worldview unraveled alongside the mythos of male supremacy.</p>

                                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">By Richard Prum</h6>
                                    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-3 text-muted">November 2023</h6>
                                    <p class="card-text">
                                        <p>Beauty standards are making the world uglier. That might sound paradoxical, but think back to the unrestrained, blatant bullying over appearances many of us witnessed—or perhaps even endured—during our school years. It's a stark reminder that our obsession with looks can bring out the worst in us. But the book I've been reading takes this a step further, arguing that the real flaw in our fixation on appearances isn't just its cruelty; it's that it's fundamentally misguided.</p>

                                        <p>There's a widely held belief that "相由心生" that all physical attractiveness offers practical information about a potential mate's genetic fitness. Even Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve Chair, once quipped to Princeton graduates: "Remember, from an evolutionary perspective, beauty assures us that the other party doesn't have too many intestinal parasites."</p>

                                        <p>But the author challenges this notion by delving into the world of birds—species like the Argus pheasant, the manakin, and the club-winged manakin. These creatures boast dazzling plumage and elaborate displays, yet their flamboyant appearances have little to do with survival or adaptability. Citing Ronald Fisher's "runaway" model, the author suggests that such extravagant traits are arbitrary. They don't convey meaningful information about fitness; they exist solely to be seen and judged.</p>

                                        <p>We often like to believe that truth, goodness, and beauty are intertwined—that "beauty is truth" and "beauty is goodness." However, evolutionary biology tells us otherwise: beauty is neither inherently true nor good; it's often just meaningless ornamentation.</p>

                                        <p>In our society, those deemed unattractive face severe discrimination. There's even a song titled "Ugly People Make More Trouble." Imagine the outrage if we swapped "ugly" for "poor" in that title. Attractive individuals tend to have more friends, better job prospects, higher incomes. But does this mean they're objectively superior? Hardly.</p>

                                        <p>Some of these showy traits can actually signal a form of regression. Take the club-winged manakin: its wings produce sounds that attract mates, but this adaptation compromises its ability to fly efficiently. And how severe is this trade-off? Mathematical models simulating evolutionary processes indicate that the cost of such extravagant traits can lead to the downfall of entire populations, even pushing species toward extinction.</p>

                                        <p>Humans aren't exempt from these pressures. We're similarly constrained by aesthetic mate selection, perhaps even more so than birds. The other driving force of evolution—natural selection—has significantly weakened in our case. In 15th-century England, only about 50% of infants survived to reproductive age. Today, that number is around 99%. So "I died for Beauty" isn't just poetic musing; it could be a looming reality for our species.</p>

                                        <p>Another flaw in our appearance-obsessed culture is the belief that beauty adheres to a universal standard. I recently came across someone lamenting that Hollywood has been "ruined by political correctness," all because a film featured actors who didn't fit the blonde, blue-eyed archetype. It's perplexing, especially when this sentiment comes from someone in China, adopting a Western-centric ideal of beauty and insisting it's the only standard.</p>

                                        <p>In truth, beauty has no fixed standard. Any perceivable trait can be deemed beautiful. Building on Fisher's theory, mathematical biologists like Russ Lande and Mark Kirkpatrick have shown that the equilibrium between natural selection and sexual selection isn't singular. For any given trait, there's a balance line with countless stable points where these evolutionary forces align. Essentially, any noticeable characteristic can reach a stable evolutionary balance through a mix of sexual and natural selection.</p>

                                        <p>Tall and slender can be beautiful; so can short and full-figured. When "traits" and "preferences" align, they create positive feedback loops, leading to the co-evolution of beauty and aesthetic taste. The author notes his research with the Saramaccan people in Suriname, where men often made overtly suggestive comments to passing women. The most admired among them was a young woman standing about 5'4" and weighing around 180 pounds.</p>

                                        <p>But modern humans have drifted away from this natural diversity of aesthetic appreciation. The rich tapestry of "natural aesthetics" has been overshadowed by a monolithic "social aesthetic" imposed by dominant cultures. Advocating for a "politically correct" appreciation of beauty isn't just about fostering a more progressive, inclusive society; it's about reclaiming the multifaceted essence of beauty itself.</p>

                                        <p>In an era where being "appearance-focused" can lead to a narrower, uglier worldview—not just in how we see others, but in how we value ourselves—it's crucial to rethink our perceptions. Beauty isn't a one-size-fits-all standard dictated by arbitrary norms. It's a diverse, evolving concept, shaped by cultural contexts and individual preferences.</p>

                                        <p>Embracing this plurality doesn't just benefit those who fall outside conventional standards; it enriches all of us. It allows for a society where we can appreciate the full spectrum of human diversity, and where beauty becomes a celebration of uniqueness rather than a tool for exclusion.</p>

                                        <p>By returning to the pluralistic nature of beauty, we not only align more closely with the realities of evolutionary biology but also pave the way for a more compassionate and inclusive world. After all, if nature thrives on diversity, perhaps our appreciation of beauty should too.</p>
